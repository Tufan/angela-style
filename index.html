                <p>I love facilitating energising discussions that support organisations to get really clear about the

                    supporting charities to develop strategies that make sense in a rapidly changing world. As an
                    experienced trustee and chair - currently of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust - I also understand
                    the importance of good governance and enjoy supporting organisations to reflect on and improve their
                    governance practice.</p>

                                with her. I felt comfortable and confident with Angela from the start â€“ she was able to
                                rapidly identify our needs as a small but growing charity and use this to create a
                                really impactful and output-driven day. She is a highly skilled facilitator who knew
                                when to let the conversation flow and when to move us forward which was exactly what we
                                needed. Angela created a safe and relaxed atmosphere wherein we were able to address
                                challenges and agree on a plan for the future. I would highly recommend her services."
